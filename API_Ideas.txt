fix my address

perhaps the datavask can provide location data or atleast data for the weather api


?parameters


get ip from visitor:
https://api.aruljohn.com/ip

use that below:

http://ip-api.com/json/80.208.65.34
ip to country
perhaps this can give parameters for the weather api below:

use lat and lon in weather app:

weather

55.675799,12.571673 (r√•dhuspladsen)

remember to map indexes to something useful for visitor

timepoint = hours after init datetime,
"init" : "2024051606", timepoint =3 = 2024-05-16 09:00

we need a function with now()-init to get diff and select the timepoint relevant to now.
